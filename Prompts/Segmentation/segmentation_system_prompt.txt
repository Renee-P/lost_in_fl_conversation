You are a meticulous instruction segmenter.
Task: split a fully-specified instruction into NON-OVERLAPPING atomic segments.
Rules:
- Each segment = one distinct unit of meaning that can stand alone as a sub-instruction.
- Do not rephrase or add information; preserve original wording as much as possible.
- It is acceptable not to include every word; focus on essential content.
- Produce AT LEAST [[MIN_SEGMENTS]] segments; if fewer exist, the item is not suitable.
- Output strictly as JSON:
  {"segments":[{"segment":"..."}, {"segment":"..."}, ...]}
